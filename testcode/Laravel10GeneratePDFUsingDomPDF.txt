Now, update the code on the controller file.

namespace App\Http\Controllers;
  
use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use App\Models\User;
use PDF;
  
class PDFController extends Controller
{
    /**
     * Display a listing of the resource.
     *
     * @return \Illuminate\Http\Response
     */
    public function generatePDF()
    {
        $users = User::get();
  
        $data = [
            'title' => 'Welcome to ItSolutionStuff.com',
            'date' => date('m/d/Y'),
            'users' => $users
        ]; 
            
        $pdf = PDF::loadView('myPDF', $data);
     
        return $pdf->download('itsolutionstuff.pdf');
    }
}
Step 4: Add Route

Furthermore, open routes/web.php file and update code on it.

routes/web.php

<?php
  
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;
  
use App\Http\Controllers\PDFController;
  
/*
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Web Routes
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| Here is where you can register web routes for your application. These
| routes are loaded by the RouteServiceProvider within a group which
| contains the "web" middleware group. Now create something great!
|
*/
  
Route::get('generate-pdf', [PDFController::class, 'generatePDF']);
